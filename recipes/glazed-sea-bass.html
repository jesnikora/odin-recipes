        <p>The fermented soybean paste called miso, a staple of Japanese cooking, is used in salad dressings; as a pickling agent; as a base for soups; and, as here, to flavor marinades. Combined with mirin and sake—Japanese wines made from rice—and flecked with fresh ginger, the marinade is brushed on the fish during cooking to create a shimmering, subtly sweet and rich savory glaze. Red snapper or another sea bass can be used in place of the Chilean sea bass.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup sake</li>
            <li>1/3 cup mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)*</li>
            <li>1/3 cup light yellow miso (fermented soybean paste)*</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (packed) brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 6-ounce sea bass fillets (each about 3/4 inch thick)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onions</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix first 5 ingredients in shallow glass baking dish. Add fish and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat broiler. Remove fish from marinade. Place fish on rimmed baking sheet. With broiler door slightly open, broil fish 6 inches from heat source until just opaque in center, about 6 minutes. Transfer to plates. Sprinkle with green onions and basil and serve.</li>
        </ol>
