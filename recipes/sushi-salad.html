            <li>1 (6-inch) square toasted nori (dried laver), cut into very thin strips with scissors</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse rice in several changes of cold water in a bowl until water is almost clear, then drain in a colander 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring rice and 1 3/4 cups water to a boil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan, then simmer, covered, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let rice stand, covered, 10 minutes (do not lift lid).</li>
            <li>While rice is standing, bring vinegar, sugar, and salt just to a boil in a very small saucepan, stirring constantly until sugar is dissolved, then cool 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread rice in a large shallow baking pan, then sprinkle with vinegar mixture and toss with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Shave thin lengthwise slices from carrot with a vegetable peeler, then cut slices diagonally into 1/4-inch-wide strips.</li>
            <li>Whisk together wasabi, remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons water, and oil in a bowl, then add rice, carrot, cucumber, scallions, pickled ginger, and sesame seeds and toss gently.</li>
            <li>Halve, pit, and peel avocado and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange 2 shiso leaves (if using) on each of 4 plates. Top with avocado and rice mixture and sprinkle with nori strips.</li>
        </ol>
